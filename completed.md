## Section 1: Add deep-agent library dependency

**Single goal:** Declare and lock the LangGraph deep-agent library so the tracer can be built with `create_deep_agent` (or equivalent) as the single graph implementation.

### Completed work
- Added `deepagents>=0.4.6` to backend dependencies in `src/backend/pyproject.toml`.
- Refreshed `src/backend/uv.lock` to include `deepagents` and its resolved transitive dependencies.
- No tracer implementation code changes were made in this section.

### Validation commands and outcomes
- `docker compose exec backend uv sync`
  - Outcome: success (`Resolved 93 packages ... Audited 90 packages`, no resolution errors).
- `docker compose exec backend uv run python -c "from deepagents import create_deep_agent; print('deepagents import ok (post-rebuild)')"`
  - Outcome: success (`deepagents import ok (post-rebuild)`).

### Container restart/rebuild logs
- Fresh start before work:
  - `docker compose down -v --rmi all`
  - `docker compose build`
  - `docker compose up -d`
- Dependency-change rebuild after updates:
  - `docker compose down`
  - `docker compose build`
  - `docker compose up -d`
  - `docker compose ps` showed `db`, `backend`, `frontend`, and `chrome` all `Up`.
- Post-rebuild service logs checked:
  - `docker compose logs --tail=120 backend` -> Uvicorn started, Alembic migration context loaded.
  - `docker compose logs --tail=120 frontend` -> Vite dev server ready.
  - `docker compose logs --tail=120 db` -> PostgreSQL ready to accept connections.

### Notes
- Build/runtime now includes `deepagents==0.4.6` in backend image.
